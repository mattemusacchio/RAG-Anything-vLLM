RAG-Anything Integration Test Document

This document serves as a test file for verification of the RAG pipeline integration with vLLM (Virtual Large Language Model).

Key Concepts:
1. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): A technique that enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base.
2. vLLM: An open-source LLM inference engine optimized for high throughput and low latency. It provides an OpenAI-compatible API.
3. RAG-Anything: A framework designed to handle multimodal documents, building two types of graphs: Semantic Graph and Structural Graph.

Configuration:
- Backend: vLLM (serving Qwen2.5 or similar)
- Port: 8000
- Integration: Using standard OpenAI client compatibility.

If this text is retrieved and used to answer the query "What uses an OpenAI-compatible API?", then the integration is successful.
